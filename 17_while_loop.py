# While Loop :
# As the name suggest,while loop execute statement while the  condition is True. 
# As soon as the condition becomes false, the interpreter comes out of the while loop.

# i = 0
# while(i<=3):
#     print(i)
#     i = i + 1

# print("done with the loop")

# i = int(input("Enter the number: "))
# while(i<=38):
#     i = int(input("Enter the number: "))
# print(i)

# print("done with the loop")
